# Emma Carey

## What are my interests?

I'm interested in furthering my knowledge of coding in Python and other languages, and recently completed a Hyperion Dev boot camp in using Python for data science. 

My academic interests broadly lie in developmental psychology and psychiatry, including memory and emotion. I am also very interested in the intersection betweeen psychology and philosophy research, for example research into AI, ethical issues within psychology and psychiatry, and the philosophical aspects of psychiatric classifications.
